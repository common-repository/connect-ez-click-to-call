== Installation ==
This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working. There are two essential steps to start receiving free calls from your web site. First decide where you want to receive calls, on your phone or laptop. You have the option of downloading our Android or iOS app (links below) and installing on your phone. Otherwise, you can use any softphone you prefer, get in touch about how to create credentials or if you want to route to your PBX. The second step is installing the WordPress plugin, which is detailed below.

8. Place the relevant code on a page on the site.
9. Caller destination is your user ID from the Connect-EZ app. Its visible when you click the hamburger (top left). Long number starting with 1. Please contact us if you want to receive calls at a call centre.
